This is a file tracking system with the Python Watchdogs library. It keep track of the files you delete, modify, rename or create and gives you live indications while the program is running. This program will give the feel of a real ###WATCHDOGS HACKER

It can basically do the following:

<li>Detect File Creations</li>
<li>Detect File Modifications</li>
<li>Detect File Deletions</li>
<li>Detect File Renamings</li>

<b>NOTE:</b> Sometimes you might see that when you modify or rename a file it also says deleted a certain file. This is because in the background tasks keep running when you modify a file which you cannot see. But Python Watchdogs brings that out
